I am a first-year PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) NLP Group, where I am supervised by Professor Junxian He. My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, with particular interests in LLM reasoning, reinforcement learning, hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLM), and LLM truthfulness and interpretability.
